# ChooseTask
This program I worte to ease my daily task. So instead of give shortcut keys to your apps, add all your app details in auto_programs.json in same json format. and create the shortcut of autoMenu.bat and assign one shortcut.
and using that shorcut you can run automenu.bat and choose your task.
